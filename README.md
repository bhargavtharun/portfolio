## PUBLICATION
Title: “Object detection, 3-D coordinate extraction and pose estimation for an autonomous medical robot”      2021

	Published a Conference Paper in 5TH International Conference on Computer, Communication and signal Processing (ICCCSP2021)-IEEE Xplore						     
## PROJECTS
Title: Object detection, face recognition and implementation of SLAM for an autonomous medical robot                                                                                                 
	Developed an algorithm that caters to the needs of a medical robot. An object detection algorithm is trained on the kinds of objects that are likely to occur in a medical environment, and the three-dimensional coordinates of the detected object are extracted. An approach that incorporates edge detection and linear regression to find the object's 2-D orientation is described and implemented 	     Apr 2020 – Apr 2021
