# Assistant Professor @ Oklahoma State University

#### About
As a research engineer at Advanced Energy Materials, LLC, I apply my academic and research background, as well as my innovative and analytical skills, to develop and test new energy materials and devices for various industrial and environmental needs. I have a PhD in Chemical Engineering from the University of Louisville and a Bachelors in Chemical Engineering from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, with over 15 years of experience in the field of energy conversion and storage.

I have invented novel materials and techniques, such as metal nanoclusters covered metal oxide nanowires as high capacity stable anode materials for lithium ion batteries, large area synthesis of SnO2 and carbon microtubes using chemical vapor deposition, and a new surface area determination technique for nanomaterials. I have also published multiple papers in prestigious journals, and obtained multiple patents for my inventions. I have expertise in material synthesis by numerous CVD and PVD techniques, lithium ion battery fabrication, electrochemical testing and analysis, and characterization techniques, such as SEM, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, and TEM. I also have skills in scattering and research proposals. My mission is to contribute to the advancement of science and technology in the field of energy materials and devices, and to create sustainable and efficient solutions for the global energy challenges.

## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
